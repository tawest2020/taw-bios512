# My BIOS512 Repo
This is my homework repository!  
  
Below is codes to remember when using GitBash
  
cd ~/<file/path> selects a file to run git from  
  
git add <file/path> | selects a file to add to repository  
  
git rm <file/path> | selects a file to remove from repository  
  
echo "<text/paste>" <file/path> | makes changes to an existing or creates a new file  
  
git commit -m "<text/comment>" | adds a note to the log marking the change  
  
git push origin main | confirms the change from Local Files into GitHub

git pull origin main | confirms the change from GitHub to Local Files
  
git status | shows what edits have been made between local and github  
  
nano <file/path> | enter into a .md file and edit the text
